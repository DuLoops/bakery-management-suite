# Bakery Management Suite Architecture

## System Overview

The Bakery Management Suite consists of two primary applications that serve different but complementary purposes in a bakery's operations. These applications can be used independently or together to create a comprehensive management system.

## Application Components

### Inventory & POS System

The inventory and POS integration system is built with the following components:

1. **React Frontend**
   - Modern component-based architecture
   - Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
   - Material UI components for consistent styling

2. **Firebase Backend**
   - Realtime Database for inventory tracking
   - Authentication for staff access control
   - Cloud Functions for automated processes

3. **Loyverse POS Integration**
   - API-based data synchronization
   - Real-time sales data
   - Inventory updates based on sales

4. **Customer Display Screen**
   - Order confirmation display
   - Marketing content during idle time
   - Real-time order status updates

### Recipe Calculator

The recipe calculator is designed with the following architecture:

1. **React/TypeScript Frontend**
   - Type-safe component structure
   - State management with React hooks
   - Form validation for recipe inputs

2. **Vite Build System**
   - Fast development experience
   - Optimized production builds
   - Modern ES module support

3. **Calculator Modules**
   - Tart production calculator
   - Ingredient measurement conversion
   - Time estimation for production tasks

## Data Flow

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
| Loyverse POS      |------>| Inventory System  |
| - Sales data      |       | - Stock tracking  |
| - Customer info   |       | - Order history   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
                                     |
                                     v
                            +-------------------+
                            | Recipe Calculator |
                            | - Production plan |
                            | - Ingredient needs|
                            +-------------------+
```

## Integration Points

While the two applications can function independently, they share several integration points:

1. **Production Planning**
   - Inventory levels inform calculator recommendations
   - Production plans can update expected inventory

2. **Ingredient Management**
   - Recipe calculator can estimate ingredient usage
   - Inventory system tracks actual ingredient levels

3. **Reporting**
   - Combined data provides comprehensive business insights
   - Production efficiency can be measured against sales
